TABLE_SELECTION_PROMPT = """You are a database architect helping identify which tables are needed to answer a user's question.

## TASK
From the list of available tables, select only the tables needed to answer the user's question.

## AVAILABLE TABLES
{compact_schema}

## USER QUESTION
{prompt}

## CHAIN OF THOUGHT REASONING
Before selecting tables, think step by step:

**Step 1: Understanding the Question**
- What is the user really asking for?
- What entities or concepts are mentioned? (e.g., products, sales, customers, dates)
- What metrics or dimensions does the answer require?

**Step 2: Mapping Concepts to Tables**
- Which table descriptions match the entities mentioned in the question?
- Is the question asking about relationships between multiple entities (implies a JOIN)?
- Are any tables clearly irrelevant (different domain, different subject)?

**Step 3: Identifying Required Joins**
- If multiple entities are needed, which tables contain them?
- Do any tables serve as lookup/dimension tables needed to label results?
- Is there a fact table that connects the needed entities?

**Step 4: Checking Completeness**
- Do the selected tables together contain all the data needed to answer the question?
- Is any additional table needed for filtering or context?
- Are there redundant tables containing the same data?

**Step 5: Final Selection**
- List only the table names that are necessary and sufficient to answer the question
- When in doubt, include a table rather than exclude it (extra context is better than missing data)
- Use only table names exactly as listed in AVAILABLE TABLES

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Return ONLY a comma-separated list of table names. No explanations. No markdown. Just table names.
Example: sales,products

SQL_GENERATION_PROMPT = """You are an expert SQL developer specializing in DuckDB queries for data analysis and visualization.

## TASK
Generate a DuckDB SQL query to answer the user's question and provide data optimized for visualization.

## AVAILABLE DATA
{schema_context}

## USER QUESTION
{prompt}

## VISUALIZATION GOAL
{visualization_goal}

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Analyze the user's question to identify what data is needed
2. Consider the visualization goal to structure the query output appropriately
3. Select appropriate columns from the schema above
4. Use proper SQL syntax for filtering, aggregation, sorting, and joins across tables
5. For DATE columns with pattern matching, CAST to VARCHAR: CAST(date_column AS VARCHAR) LIKE '%2021-11%'
6. Handle NULL values appropriately
7. Use DuckDB-specific functions when beneficial

## QUERY OPTIMIZATION FOR VISUALIZATION
- **For time series plots**: Ensure dates are sorted chronologically, use DATE_TRUNC for proper granularity
- **For bar charts**: Aggregate data by category, order by the metric being compared
- **For scatter plots**: Select two numeric columns that show relationships
- **For trend analysis**: Include time-based grouping (daily, monthly, yearly)
- **General**: Limit result size if needed, ensure clean column names for axis labels

## CHAIN OF THOUGHT REASONING
Before generating the SQL query, think step by step:

**Step 1: Understanding the Request**
- What is the user really asking for?
- What is the main entity or metric of interest?
- What time period or filters are implied?

**Step 2: Identifying Required Data**
- Which columns from the schema above are relevant to answer this question?
- Do I need data from multiple tables? If yes, what JOIN keys connect them?
- Do I need to filter the data? If yes, on which column(s)?
- Do I need aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG)? If yes, on which column(s)?
- Do I need grouping? If yes, by which column(s)?

**Step 3: Considering Visualization Needs**
- Based on the visualization goal "{visualization_goal}", what chart type is likely?
- For time series: Need chronological ordering and proper date format
- For comparisons: Need categorical grouping and clear labels
- For correlations: Need two numeric columns without aggregation
- What should be on X-axis vs Y-axis?

**Step 4: Query Structure Planning**
- SELECT: Which columns and aggregations?
- FROM: Which table(s)? Use JOINs if data spans multiple tables
- WHERE: What filters are needed?
- GROUP BY: Which columns for aggregation?
- ORDER BY: How should results be sorted?
- LIMIT: Should I limit the result set?

**Step 5: Handling Edge Cases**
- Are there DATE columns that need CAST to VARCHAR for pattern matching?
- Are there potential NULL values that need filtering?
- Do column names need aliasing for better visualization labels?
- Are table aliases needed for clarity in multi-table queries?



## EXAMPLES WITH REASONING

Example 1:
Question: "Show me sales from November 2021"
Visualization: "Monthly sales trend"
Reasoning:
- Step 1: User wants sales data for a specific month
- Step 2: Need Date and Revenue columns from sales table, filter by date pattern
- Step 3: Time series chart → need dates sorted, aggregate by date
- Step 4: SELECT Date, SUM(Revenue), WHERE date matches, GROUP BY Date, ORDER BY Date
- Step 5: Must CAST Date to VARCHAR for LIKE pattern matching
Query: SELECT Date, SUM(Revenue) as Total_Revenue FROM sales WHERE CAST(Date AS VARCHAR) LIKE '%2021-11%' GROUP BY Date ORDER BY Date

Example 2:
Question: "What are the top 5 products by total revenue?"
Visualization: "Compare products by revenue"
Reasoning:
- Step 1: User wants product ranking by revenue
- Step 2: Need Product_Name and Revenue, aggregate revenue per product
- Step 3: Bar chart → categorical comparison, needs ordering, limit to top 5
- Step 4: SELECT Product_Name, SUM(Revenue), GROUP BY product, ORDER BY revenue DESC, LIMIT 5
- Step 5: No special edge cases
Query: SELECT Product_Name, SUM(Revenue) as Total_Revenue FROM sales GROUP BY Product_ID, Product_Name ORDER BY Total_Revenue DESC LIMIT 5

Example 3:
Question: "Show monthly total sales for 2021"
Visualization: "Revenue trends over time"
Reasoning:
- Step 1: User wants monthly aggregation for a specific year
- Step 2: Need Date and Revenue, filter by year, group by month
- Step 3: Time series → need DATE_TRUNC for monthly granularity, chronological order
- Step 4: SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', Date), SUM(Revenue), WHERE year=2021, GROUP BY month, ORDER BY month
- Step 5: Use EXTRACT for year filtering
Query: SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', Date) as Month, SUM(Revenue) as Monthly_Sales FROM sales WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM Date) = 2021 GROUP BY Month ORDER BY Month

Example 4:
Question: "Analyze price vs demand relationship"
Visualization: "Price vs demand correlation"
Reasoning:
- Step 1: User wants to see correlation between two variables
- Step 2: Need Price and Units_Sold columns from the same table, no aggregation (scatter plot)
- Step 3: Scatter plot → need individual data points, both axes numeric
- Step 4: SELECT Price, Units_Sold, no GROUP BY needed
- Step 5: Filter out NULLs to avoid chart issues
Query: SELECT Price, Units_Sold FROM sales WHERE Price IS NOT NULL AND Units_Sold IS NOT NULL

Example 5 (multi-table):
Question: "Show total revenue by product category for 2023"
Visualization: "Bar chart of revenue by category"
Schema:
  Table: sales (columns: Sold_Date, SKU_Coded, Total_Sale_Value)
  Table: products (columns: SKU_Coded, Category, Product_Name)
Reasoning:
- Step 1: User wants revenue aggregated by product category
- Step 2: Revenue is in sales; Category is in products — need JOIN on SKU_Coded
- Step 3: Bar chart → group by category, aggregate revenue, order descending
- Step 4: SELECT p.Category, SUM(s.Total_Sale_Value) FROM sales s JOIN products p ON s.SKU_Coded = p.SKU_Coded WHERE year=2023 GROUP BY p.Category ORDER BY revenue DESC
- Step 5: Use EXTRACT for year filter; alias table names for clarity
Query: SELECT p.Category, SUM(s.Total_Sale_Value) as Total_Revenue FROM sales s JOIN products p ON s.SKU_Coded = p.SKU_Coded WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM s.Sold_Date) = 2023 GROUP BY p.Category ORDER BY Total_Revenue DESC

## AVAILABLE TOOLS
- lookup_sales_data: Retrieves data from the database using SQL
- analyzing_data: Analyzes retrieved data and provides insights
- create_visualization: Generates chart code to visualize the data

              ↓ Yes
          Already analyzed? No → analyzing_data
              ↓ Yes

- User's request: {state.get('prompt')}
- Answers generated so far: {state.get('answer', [])}
- Visualization goal: {state.get('visualization_goal')}
- Last tool used: {state.get('tool_choice')}

## CHAIN OF THOUGHT REASONING
Before selecting the next tool, think step by step:

**Step 1: Analyzing User Request**
- What is the user asking for? (data lookup, analysis, visualization, or combination)
- Does the request explicitly or implicitly require a chart/graph?
- Is this a simple data retrieval or complex multi-step task?

**Step 2: Checking Current Progress**
- What tools have already been executed? (check Last tool used)
- Do we have data available? (check if lookup_sales_data was run)
- How many answers have been generated? (check Answers generated so far)
- What stage of the workflow are we in?

**Step 3: Identifying What's Missing**
- If no data: Need lookup_sales_data first (Rule 1)
- If data exists but no analysis: Need analyzing_data
- If analysis exists but user wants visualization: Need create_visualization
- If all required steps done: Need end

**Step 4: Applying Decision Rules**
- Rule 1 check: Do I have data before attempting analysis/visualization?
- Rule 2 check: Am I about to repeat a tool already used?
- Rule 3 check: Have I completed all necessary steps (2+ answers OR all relevant tools)?

**Step 5: Making the Decision**
- Based on steps 1-4, which tool should execute next?
- Does this choice follow the DECISION FLOWCHART?
- Is this the minimum necessary step to progress toward completion?

## EXAMPLES WITH REASONING

Example 1 - Initial state:
State: prompt="Show sales data", answer=[], tool_choice=None

Reasoning:
- Step 1: User wants sales data (implies lookup needed)
- Step 2: No tools executed yet, no data, no answers
- Step 3: Missing everything - start with data retrieval
- Step 4: Rule 1 applies - need data first, Rule 2 N/A (nothing used), Rule 3 not met (0 answers)
- Step 5: Must start with lookup_sales_data

Decision: lookup_sales_data (need data first)

Example 2 - After data lookup:
State: prompt="Show sales data", answer=[], tool_choice="lookup_sales_data", data exists

Reasoning:
- Step 1: User wants sales data shown (implies analysis/presentation needed)
- Step 2: lookup_sales_data executed, data available, but 0 answers generated
- Step 3: Have data, missing analysis
- Step 4: Rule 1 satisfied (have data), Rule 2 check (can't repeat lookup), Rule 3 not met (0 answers)
- Step 5: Next logical step is analyzing_data

Decision: analyzing_data (have data, now analyze)

Example 3 - After analysis and visualization:
State: prompt="Show sales trends", answer=["Analysis text", "Chart code"], tool_choice="create_visualization"

Reasoning:
- Step 1: User wanted trends (implies analysis + visualization)
- Step 2: All tools executed, 2 answers generated (analysis + chart code)
- Step 3: Nothing missing - workflow complete
- Step 4: Rule 1 satisfied, Rule 2 satisfied, Rule 3 MET (2+ answers generated)
- Step 5: Should end the workflow

Decision: end (2+ answers generated, workflow complete)

Example 4 - After analysis only (no viz needed):
State: prompt="What were total sales?", answer=["Total sales were $X"], tool_choice="analyzing_data"

Reasoning:
- Step 1: User wanted a simple factual answer (no visualization implied)
- Step 2: lookup and analysis executed, 1 answer generated
- Step 3: Question fully answered with analysis alone
- Step 4: Rule 1 satisfied, Rule 2 satisfied, Rule 3 check (all RELEVANT tools done)
- Step 5: No visualization needed for this query - can end

Decision: end (all relevant tools executed, question answered)

Example 5 - After lookup only (viz needed):
State: prompt="Show me a chart of monthly sales", answer=[], tool_choice="lookup_sales_data", data exists

Reasoning:
- Step 1: User explicitly wants a chart (visualization required)
- Step 2: Only lookup executed, data available, 0 answers
- Step 3: Missing both analysis AND visualization
- Step 4: Rule 1 satisfied (have data), Rule 2 satisfied (not repeating), Rule 3 not met (0 answers)
- Step 5: Should analyze first, then visualize (follow flowchart)

Decision: analyzing_data (analyze before visualizing)

DATA_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """You are a professional data analyst providing insights from query results.

## TASK
Answer the user's question based ONLY on the provided data.

## USER QUESTION
{prompt}

## AVAILABLE DATA
This data was retrieved using the SQL query: {sql_query}

Data:
{data}

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Examine the data carefully to understand what information is available
2. Identify the key insights that directly answer the user's question
3. Provide a concise, specific answer (2-3 sentences maximum)
4. Use actual numbers and facts from the data
5. Do NOT speculate or make assumptions beyond what the data shows
6. If the data doesn't fully answer the question, state what you can determine from the available data

## CHAIN OF THOUGHT REASONING
Before answering, think step by step:

**Step 1: Understanding the Question**
- What specific information is the user asking for?
- Is it asking for a single value, a comparison, a trend, or a summary?
- What would constitute a complete answer?

**Step 2: Examining the Data Structure**
- How many rows of data are available?
- What columns are present in the data?
- What is the range or distribution of values?
- Are there any patterns or anomalies visible?

**Step 3: Extracting Relevant Facts**
- Which specific values directly answer the question?
- Do I need to perform mental calculations (sum, average, count)?
- What are the exact numbers, dates, or categories relevant to the answer?
- Are there any context clues (time periods, units, categories)?

**Step 4: Verifying Completeness**
- Does the data fully answer the user's question?
- Is there missing information that prevents a complete answer?
- Should I mention any limitations or caveats?

**Step 5: Formulating the Answer**
- How can I state the facts concisely (2-3 sentences)?
- Am I using specific numbers from the data?
- Am I avoiding speculation or assumptions?
- Is my answer direct and clear?



## EXAMPLES WITH REASONING

Example 1 - Good answer:
Question: "What were the total sales in November 2021?"
Data: Shows 45 rows with Revenue column summing to $1,234,567

Reasoning:
- Step 1: User wants total sales amount for a specific month
- Step 2: 45 rows of data, Revenue column present
- Step 3: Sum of Revenue = $1,234,567, time period = November 2021, transaction count = 45
- Step 4: Data fully answers the question, no missing info
- Step 5: State the total, mention the number of transactions, keep it factual

Answer: "Based on the data, total sales in November 2021 were $1,234,567 across 45 transactions."

Example 2 - Bad answer (do NOT do this):
Question: "What were the total sales in November 2021?"
Data: Shows 45 rows with Revenue column summing to $1,234,567

Bad Answer: "Sales were strong in November, likely due to holiday shopping. This trend probably continued into December and suggests the company is performing well."

Why this is bad:
- Violates Step 5: Adds speculation ("likely due to holiday shopping")
- Violates instruction 5: Makes assumptions beyond data ("trend continued")
- Violates Step 3: Doesn't state the actual number ($1,234,567)
- Adds interpretation not supported by data ("company performing well")

Example 3 - Handling incomplete data:
Question: "How do our November 2021 sales compare to the previous year?"
Data: Shows only November 2021 data (45 rows, $1,234,567 total)

Reasoning:
- Step 1: User wants year-over-year comparison
- Step 2: Only 2021 data present, no 2020 data
- Step 3: Can extract November 2021 total = $1,234,567
- Step 4: Cannot make comparison - missing 2020 data
- Step 5: State what we know, acknowledge limitation

Answer: "The available data shows November 2021 sales totaled $1,234,567 across 45 transactions. However, the dataset does not include November 2020 data, so a year-over-year comparison cannot be made."

Example 4 - Multiple data points:
Question: "Which product had the highest revenue?"
Data: Shows Product_Name and Revenue for 10 products, top one is "Widget Pro" with $450,000

Reasoning:
- Step 1: User wants to identify top-performing product
- Step 2: 10 rows, columns are Product_Name and Revenue
- Step 3: Maximum Revenue = $450,000, corresponding Product_Name = "Widget Pro"
- Step 4: Data fully answers the question
- Step 5: State the product name and its revenue value

Answer: "Widget Pro had the highest revenue at $450,000."

- User's request: {state.get('prompt')}
- Answers generated so far: {state.get('answer', [])}
- Visualization goal: {state.get('visualization_goal')}
- Last tool used: {state.get('tool_choice')}

## CHAIN OF THOUGHT REASONING
Before selecting the next tool, think step by step:

**Step 1: Analyzing User Request**
- What is the user asking for? (data lookup, analysis, visualization, or combination)
- Does the request explicitly or implicitly require a chart/graph?
- Is this a simple data retrieval or complex multi-step task?

**Step 2: Checking Current Progress**
- What tools have already been executed? (check Last tool used)
- Do we have data available? (check if lookup_sales_data was run)
- How many answers have been generated? (check Answers generated so far)
- What stage of the workflow are we in?

**Step 3: Identifying What's Missing**
- If no data: Need lookup_sales_data first (Rule 1)
- If data exists but no analysis: Need analyzing_data
- If analysis exists but user wants visualization: Need create_visualization
- If all required steps done: Need end

**Step 4: Applying Decision Rules**
- Rule 1 check: Do I have data before attempting analysis/visualization?
- Rule 2 check: Am I about to repeat a tool already used?
- Rule 3 check: Have I completed all necessary steps (2+ answers OR all relevant tools)?

**Step 5: Making the Decision**
- Based on steps 1-4, which tool should execute next?
- Does this choice follow the DECISION FLOWCHART?
- Is this the minimum necessary step to progress toward completion?


## EXAMPLES WITH REASONING

Example 1 - Initial state:
State: prompt="Show sales data", answer=[], tool_choice=None

Reasoning:
- Step 1: User wants sales data (implies lookup needed)
- Step 2: No tools executed yet, no data, no answers
- Step 3: Missing everything - start with data retrieval
- Step 4: Rule 1 applies - need data first, Rule 2 N/A (nothing used), Rule 3 not met (0 answers)
- Step 5: Must start with lookup_sales_data

Decision: lookup_sales_data (need data first)

Example 2 - After data lookup:
State: prompt="Show sales data", answer=[], tool_choice="lookup_sales_data", data exists

Reasoning:
- Step 1: User wants sales data shown (implies analysis/presentation needed)
- Step 2: lookup_sales_data executed, data available, but 0 answers generated
- Step 3: Have data, missing analysis
- Step 4: Rule 1 satisfied (have data), Rule 2 check (can't repeat lookup), Rule 3 not met (0 answers)
- Step 5: Next logical step is analyzing_data

Decision: analyzing_data (have data, now analyze)

Example 3 - After analysis and visualization:
State: prompt="Show sales trends", answer=["Analysis text", "Chart code"], tool_choice="create_visualization"

Reasoning:
- Step 1: User wanted trends (implies analysis + visualization)
- Step 2: All tools executed, 2 answers generated (analysis + chart code)
- Step 3: Nothing missing - workflow complete
- Step 4: Rule 1 satisfied, Rule 2 satisfied, Rule 3 MET (2+ answers generated)
- Step 5: Should end the workflow

Decision: end (2+ answers generated, workflow complete)

Example 4 - After analysis only (no viz needed):
State: prompt="What were total sales?", answer=["Total sales were $X"], tool_choice="analyzing_data"

Reasoning:
- Step 1: User wanted a simple factual answer (no visualization implied)
- Step 2: lookup and analysis executed, 1 answer generated
- Step 3: Question fully answered with analysis alone
- Step 4: Rule 1 satisfied, Rule 2 satisfied, Rule 3 check (all RELEVANT tools done)
- Step 5: No visualization needed for this query - can end

Decision: end (all relevant tools executed, question answered)

Example 5 - After lookup only (viz needed):
State: prompt="Show me a chart of monthly sales", answer=[], tool_choice="lookup_sales_data", data exists

Reasoning:
- Step 1: User explicitly wants a chart (visualization required)
- Step 2: Only lookup executed, data available, 0 answers
- Step 3: Missing both analysis AND visualization
- Step 4: Rule 1 satisfied (have data), Rule 2 satisfied (not repeating), Rule 3 not met (0 answers)
- Step 5: Should analyze first, then visualize (follow flowchart)

Decision: analyzing_data (analyze before visualizing)

CHART_CONFIGURATION_PROMPT = """You are a data visualization expert designing chart configurations.

## TASK
Create a JSON configuration object for visualizing the provided data.

## VISUALIZATION GOAL
{visualization_goal}

## DATA TO VISUALIZE
{data}

## CHART TYPE SELECTION GUIDE
Choose the appropriate chart type based on the data and goal:
- bar: Comparing discrete categories or groups (e.g., sales by product, revenue by region)
- line: Showing trends over time or continuous progression (e.g., monthly sales, daily visitors)
- scatter: Showing correlations or relationships between two variables (e.g., price vs. demand)
- area: Showing volume or cumulative values over time (e.g., cumulative revenue, market share)

## REQUIRED JSON KEYS
- chart_type: One of [bar, line, area, scatter]
- x_axis: Column name for X-axis (string)
- y_axis: Column name for Y-axis (string)
- title: Descriptive chart title (string)

## CHAIN OF THOUGHT REASONING
Before creating the configuration, think step by step:

**Step 1: Understanding the Visualization Goal**
- What story does the user want to tell with this chart?
- Is the goal to compare, show trends, find correlations, or display distributions?
- Are there any keywords that hint at chart type? (e.g., "over time" → line, "compare" → bar)

**Step 2: Analyzing the Data Structure**
- What columns are available in the data?
- Which columns contain categorical data (text, discrete values)?
- Which columns contain numerical data (integers, floats)?
- Are there any date/time columns?
- How many rows of data are there (affects visualization approach)?

**Step 3: Selecting Chart Type**
- For comparisons between categories → bar chart
- For trends over time or continuous sequences → line chart
- For showing relationships between two numeric variables → scatter plot
- For cumulative values over time → area chart
- Does the data structure support this chart type?

**Step 4: Mapping Axes**
- What should go on the X-axis? (independent variable, categories, or time)
- What should go on the Y-axis? (dependent variable, values, metrics)
- Do the chosen columns make logical sense for these axes?
- For time series: dates on X-axis, metrics on Y-axis
- For comparisons: categories on X-axis, values on Y-axis

**Step 5: Creating the Title**
- What concise phrase describes what the chart shows?
- Include the key variables or metrics being displayed
- Format: "[Metric] by/over/vs [Variable]" or similar clear structure
- Examples: "Revenue Over Time", "Sales by Product", "Price vs Demand"

Now, based on this reasoning, create the JSON configuration.

## EXAMPLES WITH REASONING

Example 1 - Time series data:
Data columns: Date, Revenue
Goal: "Show revenue trends over time"

Reasoning:
- Step 1: Goal mentions "trends over time" → time series visualization
- Step 2: Columns: Date (temporal), Revenue (numeric), likely multiple rows
- Step 3: "Over time" + "trends" → line chart is appropriate
- Step 4: X-axis = Date (time progression), Y-axis = Revenue (metric being tracked)
- Step 5: Title: "Revenue Trends Over Time" (clear, includes both variables)

Output: {{"chart_type": "line", "x_axis": "Date", "y_axis": "Revenue", "title": "Revenue Trends Over Time"}}

Example 2 - Categorical comparison:
Data columns: Product_Name, Units_Sold
Goal: "Compare products by units sold"

Reasoning:
- Step 1: Goal says "compare" → comparison visualization
- Step 2: Columns: Product_Name (categorical), Units_Sold (numeric)
- Step 3: Comparing discrete categories → bar chart is appropriate
- Step 4: X-axis = Product_Name (categories), Y-axis = Units_Sold (values to compare)
- Step 5: Title: "Units Sold by Product" (shows what's being compared)

Output: {{"chart_type": "bar", "x_axis": "Product_Name", "y_axis": "Units_Sold", "title": "Units Sold by Product"}}

Example 3 - Correlation analysis:
Data columns: Price, Demand, Product_ID
Goal: "Analyze the relationship between price and demand"

Reasoning:
- Step 1: Goal mentions "relationship between" → correlation visualization
- Step 2: Columns: Price (numeric), Demand (numeric), Product_ID (identifier)
- Step 3: Two numeric variables, looking for correlation → scatter plot
- Step 4: X-axis = Price (independent variable), Y-axis = Demand (dependent variable)
- Step 5: Title: "Price vs Demand Analysis" (shows both variables being correlated)

Output: {{"chart_type": "scatter", "x_axis": "Price", "y_axis": "Demand", "title": "Price vs Demand Analysis"}}

Example 4 - Cumulative values:
Data columns: Month, Cumulative_Sales
Goal: "Show cumulative sales growth throughout the year"

Reasoning:
- Step 1: Goal mentions "cumulative" and "growth" → volume over time
- Step 2: Columns: Month (temporal), Cumulative_Sales (numeric, accumulating)
- Step 3: Cumulative values over time → area chart emphasizes volume
- Step 4: X-axis = Month (time), Y-axis = Cumulative_Sales (accumulated metric)
- Step 5: Title: "Cumulative Sales Growth" (describes the accumulation)

Output: {{"chart_type": "area", "x_axis": "Month", "y_axis": "Cumulative_Sales", "title": "Cumulative Sales Growth"}}

Example 5 - Regional comparison:
Data columns: Region, Average_Revenue, Store_Count
Goal: "Compare average revenue across different regions"

Reasoning:
- Step 1: Goal says "compare...across" → categorical comparison
- Step 2: Columns: Region (categorical), Average_Revenue (numeric), Store_Count (numeric)
- Step 3: Comparing categories → bar chart
- Step 4: X-axis = Region (categories), Y-axis = Average_Revenue (metric from goal)
- Step 5: Title: "Average Revenue by Region" (clear comparison statement)

Output: {{"chart_type": "bar", "x_axis": "Region", "y_axis": "Average_Revenue", "title": "Average Revenue by Region"}}

CREATE_CHART_PROMPT = """You are a Python data visualization developer creating matplotlib charts.

## TASK
Generate Python code to create a chart based on the provided configuration.

## AVAILABLE IN SCOPE
- data_df: pandas DataFrame with the data (already loaded, do NOT create it)
- config: Dictionary with chart configuration (already defined, do NOT create it)
- pd: pandas module (already imported)
- plt: matplotlib.pyplot module (already imported)

## CHART CONFIGURATION
{config}

## REQUIREMENTS
Your code must:
1. Import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
2. Import pandas as pd (if needed for data manipulation)
3. Access data using: data_df[config['x_axis']] and data_df[config['y_axis']]
4. Create the appropriate chart type using config['chart_type']
5. Set the chart title using config['title']
6. Add axis labels for clarity
7. Call plt.tight_layout() before plt.show()
8. Call plt.show() at the end

## CHART TYPE IMPLEMENTATIONS

### Bar Chart (chart_type='bar'):
- Use plt.bar(x_data, y_data) for vertical bars
- Good for categorical comparisons

### Line Chart (chart_type='line'):
- Use plt.plot(x_data, y_data) for lines
- Good for time series and trends

### Scatter Plot (chart_type='scatter'):
- Use plt.scatter(x_data, y_data) for points
- Good for correlations

### Area Chart (chart_type='area'):
- Use plt.fill_between(x_data, y_data) for filled areas
- Good for cumulative values

## CRITICAL: X-AXIS LABEL OVERLAP PREVENTION
**ALWAYS check and prevent x-axis label overlapping:**
- For categorical data with many categories (>10): rotate labels 45° or 90° AND use ha='right'
- For long text labels: ALWAYS rotate even if few labels
- For dates: rotate 45° with ha='right'
- If labels are still crowded after rotation: consider reducing font size with fontsize=8
- Alternative strategies:
  * Use plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right', fontsize=9) for crowded labels
  * Use plt.xticks(rotation=90) for very long labels
  * Consider abbreviating labels if possible
  * Increase figure width with plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6)) for many data points

## CHAIN OF THOUGHT REASONING
Before writing the code, think step by step:

**Step 1: Understanding the Configuration**
- What chart type is requested? (bar, line, scatter, area)
- What are the x_axis and y_axis column names?
- What is the title for the chart?
- Are there any special characteristics suggested by the column names?

**Step 2: Planning Data Extraction**
- How do I access the x-axis data? (data_df[config['x_axis']])
- How do I access the y-axis data? (data_df[config['y_axis']])
- Do I need to handle special data types (dates, categories)?
- Should I sort or transform the data before plotting?

**Step 3: Selecting Matplotlib Function**
- For bar: plt.bar(x_data, y_data)
- For line: plt.plot(x_data, y_data)
- For scatter: plt.scatter(x_data, y_data)
- For area: plt.fill_between(x_data, y_data)
- What additional parameters improve readability? (marker, alpha, etc.)

**Step 4: Adding Chart Enhancements**
- Axis labels: plt.xlabel() and plt.ylabel() using config keys
- Title: plt.title() using config['title']
- **CRITICAL - Check X-axis label overlap potential:**
  * How many data points are there?
  * Are x-axis labels text (categorical) or dates?
  * Are the labels likely long (product names, location names)?
  * Decision: Apply rotation and alignment to prevent overlap
- For time series or scatter: add grid with plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
- Any other styling needed?

**Step 5: Finalizing and Rendering**
- Call plt.tight_layout() to prevent label cutoff (CRITICAL after rotation)
- Call plt.show() to display the chart
- Verify all requirements are met (imports, data access, chart type, labels, title)
- Double-check no syntax errors or missing steps

Now, based on this reasoning, generate the Python code.

## EXAMPLES WITH REASONING

Example 1 - Bar chart with categorical data:
config = {{"chart_type": "bar", "x_axis": "Product", "y_axis": "Sales", "title": "Sales by Product"}}

Reasoning:
- Step 1: Bar chart, x=Product (categorical), y=Sales (numeric), title provided
- Step 2: Extract data_df['Product'] and data_df['Sales'], no special handling needed
- Step 3: Use plt.bar(x_data, y_data) for vertical bars
- Step 4: Add labels, **Product names likely long → MUST rotate to prevent overlap**, apply rotation=45, ha='right'
- Step 5: tight_layout() (critical for rotated labels) then show()

Code:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

x_data = data_df[config['x_axis']]
y_data = data_df[config['y_axis']]

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(x_data, y_data)
plt.xlabel(config['x_axis'])
plt.ylabel(config['y_axis'])
plt.title(config['title'])
plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

Example 2 - Line chart with dates:
config = {{"chart_type": "line", "x_axis": "Date", "y_axis": "Revenue", "title": "Revenue Over Time"}}

Reasoning:
- Step 1: Line chart, x=Date (temporal), y=Revenue (numeric), time series visualization
- Step 2: Extract data, x-axis is dates
- Step 3: Use plt.plot(x_data, y_data) with marker='o' to show data points
- Step 4: Add labels, **dates on x-axis → rotate to prevent overlap**, add grid for trends
- Step 5: tight_layout() then show()

Code:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

x_data = data_df[config['x_axis']]
y_data = data_df[config['y_axis']]

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(x_data, y_data, marker='o')
plt.xlabel(config['x_axis'])
plt.ylabel(config['y_axis'])
plt.title(config['title'])
plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right')
plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

Example 3 - Scatter plot (no rotation needed):
config = {{"chart_type": "scatter", "x_axis": "Price", "y_axis": "Demand", "title": "Price vs Demand"}}

Reasoning:
- Step 1: Scatter plot, x=Price (numeric), y=Demand (numeric), correlation analysis
- Step 2: Extract both numeric columns, no special handling
- Step 3: Use plt.scatter(x_data, y_data) with alpha=0.6 for overlapping points
- Step 4: Add labels, **numeric x-axis → no rotation needed**, add grid for patterns
- Step 5: tight_layout() then show()

Code:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

x_data = data_df[config['x_axis']]
y_data = data_df[config['y_axis']]

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(x_data, y_data, alpha=0.6)
plt.xlabel(config['x_axis'])
plt.ylabel(config['y_axis'])
plt.title(config['title'])
plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

Example 4 - Area chart with months:
config = {{"chart_type": "area", "x_axis": "Month", "y_axis": "Cumulative_Sales", "title": "Cumulative Sales Growth"}}

Reasoning:
- Step 1: Area chart, x=Month (temporal/sequential), y=Cumulative_Sales (numeric), shows volume
- Step 2: Extract data, ensure x is in proper order
- Step 3: Use plt.fill_between(x_data, y_data) to create filled area
- Step 4: Add labels, **month names (text) → rotate to prevent overlap**, grid for progression
- Step 5: tight_layout() then show()

Code:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

x_data = data_df[config['x_axis']]
y_data = data_df[config['y_axis']]

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.fill_between(x_data, y_data, alpha=0.4)
plt.plot(x_data, y_data)
plt.xlabel(config['x_axis'])
plt.ylabel(config['y_axis'])
plt.title(config['title'])
plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right')
plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

Example 5 - Bar chart with many categories:
config = {{"chart_type": "bar", "x_axis": "Store_Location", "y_axis": "Revenue", "title": "Revenue by Store Location"}}

Reasoning:
- Step 1: Bar chart, x=Store_Location (categorical, likely many stores), y=Revenue
- Step 2: Extract data, many categories expected
- Step 3: Use plt.bar(x_data, y_data)
- Step 4: **Many stores + location names (long text) → CRITICAL overlap risk**, rotate 45°, increase figure width, reduce font size
- Step 5: tight_layout() essential for rotated labels

Code:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

x_data = data_df[config['x_axis']]
y_data = data_df[config['y_axis']]

plt.figure(figsize=(14, 6))
plt.bar(x_data, y_data)
plt.xlabel(config['x_axis'])
plt.ylabel(config['y_axis'])
plt.title(config['title'])
plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right', fontsize=9)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
